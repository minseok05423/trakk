# MATLAB Processor

This directory contains the MATLAB processing pipeline for ski run analysis.

## Structure

- `matlab_code/` - MATLAB source code (sensor fusion, turn detection, circle fitting)
- `compiled/` - Compiled MATLAB executable (generated by MATLAB Compiler)
- `scripts/` - Wrapper scripts for running MATLAB in Docker
- `test_data/` - Sample data for testing
- `docs/` - Documentation including JSON contract

## Building

1. Compile MATLAB code using MATLAB Compiler
2. Place executable in `compiled/`
3. Build Docker image: `docker build -t matlab-processor .`

## Testing Locally

```bash
./scripts/test_local.sh
```

## Deploying to AWS

See `docs/deployment.md` for instructions.
